# vowel-types
A Java program that determines whether a word has only back vowels, only front vowels, both, or neither. 
The vowels that it checks for are a, e, i , o, u, ö, ü, and ı

How it works:
- input a word or input "exit" to quit the program
- the output will tell you what kind of vowels the word has
